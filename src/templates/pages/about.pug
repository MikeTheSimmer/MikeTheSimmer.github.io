        h2.uk-text-center About Mike and his small shop
        ul.uk-list.uk-list-bullet
          li All our items have been used by Mike himself. If Mike found the item was not good enough, you won't see it at all. :P
          li Mike is willing to help his simmer fellows. If you are in rural areas of Australia and couldn't be reached by international couriers. Mike is happy to help for free. If you trust Mike, please reach out for help.
          li For all our items, instead of highlighting the pros, Mike is doing the other way - highlighting the cons. The philosophy is that if you could accept those cons, that item would be a good fit for you.
          li For all our items, Mike provides unboxing videos, review videos, compare videos, as well as gameplay as many as he can.
          li Mike is a good software engineer. :)

          li Mike didn't sell many items, but every one is quality one.
